that is, if the equation is satisfied when the substitutions x1 = s1 , x2 = s2 , . . . , xn = sn are made. A
sequence of numbers is called a solution to a system of equations if it is a solution to every equation in
the system.
For example, x = −2, y = 5, z = 0 and x = 0, y = 4, z = −1 are both solutions to the system
x+y+ z=3
2x + y + 3z = 1
