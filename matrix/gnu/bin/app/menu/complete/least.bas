/' A system may have no solution at all, or it may have a unique solution, or it may 
have an infinite family of solutions. For instance, the system x + y = 2, x + y = 3 has 
no solution because the sum of two numbers cannot be 2 and 3 simultaneously. A system 
that has no solution is called inconsistent; a system with at least one solution is 
called consistent. The system in the following example has infinitely many 
solutions.'/
